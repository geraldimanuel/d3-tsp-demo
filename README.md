d3-tsp-demo
===========

A Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver using d3.js (demo). [Check it out!](http://yanatan16.github.io/d3-tsp-demo)

_Note_: The code is a little unorganized because its in a demo state. I may at some point clean it up and add more functionality, but I release it as-is.

## What it does

First of all, it uses [d3.js](http://d3js.org), which is awesome. I learned about it and immediately made this the same night.

Secondly, it uses [Simulated Annealling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). Feel free to check out the code.
